# Exercise 18: Names, Variables, Code, Functions

## For example

In this article we will learn how to create functions in python.

In python, use the * def * keyword to define the function.

Script:      # This function is similar to the argument argv      def print_two (* args):         arg1, arg2 = args         print "arg1:% r, arg2:% r"% (arg1, arg2)      # Define a function with two      def parameters print_two_again (arg1, arg2):         print "arg1:% r, arg2:% r"% (arg1, arg2)      # Defines the function with 1 parameter      def print_one (arg1):         print "arg1:% r"% arg1      # Defining the function without the parameter      def print_none ():         print "I got nothin '."      print_two ("Zed", "Shaw")      print_two_again ("Zed", "Shaw")      print_one ("First!")      print_none ()



















## Explain a script.

* Functions defined in python with the keyword def. Syntax * def function_name ([parameter_], [parameter_], ...): * * The function block must be 4 spaces away and must be equal.  


## Chạy code     $ python ex18.py    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw'    arg1: 'Zed', arg2: 'Shaw'    arg1: 'First!'    I got nothin'.






    
## Practice

Creating a checklist function for posts after creating a function must use the checklist to check. 

* Have you started your function with def definition? * Does your function have an underscore character "_"? * You put characters "(" after function name yet? * You have set parameters after character "(" no? * You create the parameters are not duplicated ko? * You can set parameters parties ends with "):"? * Do you put the command lines you want after 4 spaces? * Do you end the function by without indentation?








When you run a function, check this: 

* Do you run this function by typing a name? * Do you name the function after the "("? * Do you put the values ​​in parentheses and separated by commas? * Do you end up calling the function with the "" character)? "




## Question

* What do the "*" characters in * args do for?     This will say hold all the parameters to the functions and then put them in the args as a list. It is the same as argv that you use, but for functions. It is not normally used for special cases. * Is this really boring and monotonous?      That is a good thing. It means that you have typed the code and understand the code.
