# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters

## I. For example

Comments are extremely important in your applications. They are used to tell you what things are, and are used to disable parts of your program if you want to remove them temporarily. Here's how to use comments in python:

```sh
#!/bin/python2
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# ex2: Comments and Pound Characters

# A comment, this is so you can read you program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this."  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
```

Your program may look different, but what's important is the text that you type into the file in the text editor. In fact, I can work with any editor and the results will be the same.
