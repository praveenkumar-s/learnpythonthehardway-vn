Now you know * if-staments * I give you some rules for * for-loop * and * while-loop * . I will also give you some debugging tips so you can find problems with your program. Finally, you will design a small game similar to the last exercise the previous section, but with a slight change.

## Rules for if-staments

1. Each * if-staments * must have * else * 2. Do not put 2 nested * if-else * loops 3. Your variable should be simple and choose a good name for the variable 4. Treat each * if- else * as a paragraph and * if-ifelse-else * as a set of paragraphs.




If you master the basic rules above, you will write other complex programs better 

### Warning

Never be a slave to rules in real life. For training purposes you need to follow the rules to make your mind strong, but in real life sometimes these rules are just stupid. If you think a rule is stupid, try not to use it.

## Rules for loop

Use * while * loop for infinite loop

Use the * for * loop when the number of times the loop is limited

## Tips for Debugging

1. Do not use "troubleshooting". A debugger is like doing a whole body scan on a sick person. You don't get any specific useful information, and you find a whole lot of information that just finds confusing 2. The best way to debug a program is to use * print * to print it out. the values ​​of variables at points in the program to see if that is wrong. 3. Make sure parts of your program work as you work with them. Do not write large files before you run them. Write and run each block of code each function to capture the program



##Homework

Now, create a small game similar to the one created in the previous article. Use all the knowledge learned in the previous sections to gradually build on the game

Before starting to write the program, let's draw a game diagram. Create rooms, monsters as well as traps that appear when the user plays. After completing the game map, embark on building the game

Write each small module of the program by following the steps below

1. On a piece of paper or a business card, write a list of tasks you need to complete to finish the software. This is your to-do list. 2. Choose the easiest task of a business card you can do. 3. Write a comment for each line of code 4. Run the program as soon as it can 5. Continue to write the program, make sure the program is always running 6. Complete the task and continue with the next task






Some of the above tips will help you write effective and scientific programs
