Excercise 1: Good First Program
I. For example.
1.1. In this article, we will create an excercise1.py file to print on the screen but with strings.
2 B1: Create a file exercise1.py insert the following content into the file:

print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
B2: After entering the above commands we save the file

B3: Run the following command:

# python excercise1.py
B4: The screen will appear as follows:



Complete the first post.

Note: If you want to type Vietnamese, add the following line to the beginning of the file:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
1.2 An error occurred in python file.
In the file excercise1.py we put an apostrophe at the end of the line.

print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.
After the run is done, save the file and run the file excercise1.py again. The following error will appear:



Python will tell us that there is an error in the 8th line. You can fix it by searching for this error online.

II. Practice
2.1 Try printing other lines on the screen.

2.2 Try printing only one line.

2.3 Put a "#" character at the beginning of each line and try to run the program again

Nếu sử dụng kí tự "#" đầu dòng thì dòng này sẽ bị coi là phần chú thích lên không chạy. Trong python sử dụng kí tự "#" để chú thích.
