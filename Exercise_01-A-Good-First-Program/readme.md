# Excercise 1: Good First Program

## I. For example

### 1.1.In this article, we will create an excercise1.py file to print on the screen but with strings.
2
B1: Create a file exercise1.py insert the following content into the file:

    print "Hello World!"
    print "Hello Again"
    print "I like typing this."
    print "This is fun."
    print 'Yay! Printing.'
    print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
    print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

B2: After entering the above commands we save the file


B3: Run the following command

    # python excercise1.py

B4: The screen will appear as follows:

Complete the first post.

Note: If you want to type Vietnamese, add the following line to the beginning of the file:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
### 1.2 An error occurred in python file.

 In the file excercise1.py we put an apostrophe at the end of the line
    
    print "Hello World!"
    print "Hello Again"
    print "I like typing this."
    print "This is fun."
    print 'Yay! Printing.'
    print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
    print 'I "said" do not touch this.
 
After the run is done, save the file and run the file excercise1.py again. The following error will appear:

 Python sẽ nói với chúng ta là có lỗi tại dòng thứ 8. Bạn có thể fix bằng cách tìm kiếm lỗi báo này trên mạng.
 
## II. Practice

2.1 Try printing other lines on the screen.

2.2 Try printing only one line
